## Why Are We Building This?

Notion has been our favorite project and knowledge management tool in recent years due to its aesthetic appeal and functionality. Our team uses it daily, and we are on its paid plan. However, as we all know, Notion has its limitations, including weak data security and poor compatibility with mobile devices. Similarly, alternative collaborative workplace management tools also have their constraints.

The limitations we encountered using these tools and our past work experience with collaborative productivity tools have led to our firm belief that there is a glass ceiling on what's possible for these tools in the future. This arises from the fact that these tools will likely struggle to scale horizontally at some point and be forced to prioritize a proportion of customers whose needs differ from the rest. While decision-makers desire a workplace OS, it's impossible to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution in such a fragmented market.

When a customer's evolving core needs are not met, they either switch to another tool or build one in-house from scratch. Consequently, they either encounter another ceiling or pay a high price to learn a tough lesson. This requires substantial resources and expertise to build a reliable and user-friendly collaborative tool, not to mention speed and a native experience. The same can apply to individual users.

All these constraints drive our mission - to make it possible for anyone to create apps that suit their needs perfectly.

* For individuals, we aim to provide Notion's functionality, data security, and cross-platform native experience.
* For enterprises and developers, AppFlowy is dedicated to offering building blocks and collaboration infrastructure services to empower you to create apps on your own. Moreover, you have complete control over your data. You can design and modify AppFlowy according to your preferences, with a single codebase written in Flutter and Rust that supports multiple platforms and ensures long-term maintainability.

We've decided to accomplish this mission by upholding three fundamental values:

* Data privacy comes first.
* Reliable native experience.
* Community-driven extensibility.

We don't claim to outperform Notion in terms of functionality and design, at least not for now. Additionally, our focus isn't solely on adding more functionality at the moment. Instead, we aim to nurture a community that democratizes knowledge and the process of creating complex workplace management tools. We aim to empower people and businesses to create remarkable things on their own by providing them with a versatile toolbox of building blocks.
