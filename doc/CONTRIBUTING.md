### Non-coding Contributions

You want to work on the project, but you're not a developer? You can help in multiple ways - even if you don't write code! You can still give back your love to our community. Here are a few ideas:

- Answer questions having ""General help wanted" or "Technical help wanted" labels on the [forum](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy/discussions)
- Improve the documentation.
- Be an AppFlowy ambassador or evangelist! Proprietary software companies often have dedicated marketing teams to get more users, but luckily we have something better: you! Share your experience with AppFlowy! This can be anything:
    - Write a life-hacks-style blog post on how you or your company use AppFlowy to get things done.
    - Spread the word on all social media platforms to get more people to join the community. To name a few channels, Product Hunt, Hacker Noon, Quora, Reddit, and Stack Overflow are good choices.
    - Give a lightning talk at your local hackerspace on why you love AppFlowy.
    - Write a review of the pros and cons of similar open source apps.
