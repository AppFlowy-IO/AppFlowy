/// Integration tests for an empty document. The [TestWorkspaceService] will load a workspace from an empty document `assets/test/workspaces/empty_document.zip` for all tests.
///
/// To create another integration test with a preconfigured workspace. Use the following steps:
/// 1. Create a new workspace from the AppFlowy launch screen.
/// 2. Modify the workspace until it is suitable as the starting point for the integration test you need to land.
/// 3. Use a zip utility program to zip the workspace folder that you created.
/// 4. Add the zip file under `assets/test/workspaces/`
/// 5. Add a new enumeration to [TestWorkspace] in `integration_test/utils/data.dart`. For example, if you added a workspace called `empty_calendar.zip`, then [TestWorkspace] should have the following value:
/// ```dart
/// enum TestWorkspace {
///   board('board'),
///   empty_calendar('empty_calendar');
///
///   /* code */
/// }
/// ```
/// 6. Double check that the .zip file that you added is included as an asset in the pubspec.yaml file under appflowy_flutter.
