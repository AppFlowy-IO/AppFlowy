## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the AppFlowy Web project! This project aims to bring the powerful features of AppFlowy to the web. Whether
you're a developer looking to contribute or a user eager to try out the latest features, this guide will help you get
started.

AppFlowy Web is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Bun**: A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
- **Nginx**: A high-performance web server.
- **Docker**: A platform to develop, ship, and run applications in containers.

### Resource Sharing

To maintain consistency across different platforms, the Web project shares i18n translation files and Icons with the
Flutter project. This ensures a unified user experience and reduces duplication of effort in maintaining these
resources.

- **i18n Translation Files**: The translation files are shared to provide a consistent localization experience across
  both Web and Flutter applications. The path to the translation files is `frontend/resources/translations/`.

  > The translation files are stored in JSON format and contain translations for different languages. The files are
  named according to the language code (e.g., `en.json` for English, `es.json` for Spanish, etc.).

- **Icons**: The icon set used in the Web project is the same as the one used in the Flutter project, ensuring visual
  consistency. The icons are stored in the `frontend/resources/flowy_icons/` directory.

Let's dive in and get the project up and running! 🚀

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.6.0) 🌳
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (package manager) 📦
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (testing framework) 🃏
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (end-to-end testing) 🧪

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy.git
cd frontend/appflowy_web_app
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
## ensure you have pnpm installed, if not run the following command
# npm install -g pnpm@8.5.0

pnpm install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
AF_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
AF_GOTRUE_URL=http://localhost:9999
AF_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws/v1
```

### Start the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### 🚀 Building for Production(Optional)

if you want to run the production build, use the following commands

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

This will start the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Unit Tests

We use **Jest** for running unit tests. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run test:unit
```

This will execute all the unit tests in the project and provide a summary of the results. ✅

### Components Tests

We use **Cypress** for end-to-end testing. To run the Cypress tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run cypress:open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner where you can run your end-to-end tests. 🧪

Alternatively, to run Cypress tests in the headless mode, use:

```bash
pnpm run test:components
```

Both commands will provide detailed test results and generate a code coverage report.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Linting

To maintain code quality, we use **ESLint**. To run the linter and fix any linting errors, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Our production deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions. The process involves:

1. **Setting up an AWS EC2 instance**: We use an EC2 instance to host the application.
2. **Installing Docker and Docker Compose**: Docker is installed on the AWS instance.
3. **Configuring SSH Access**: SSH access is set up with a user and password.
4. **Preparing Project Configuration**: We configure `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`, and `server.cjs` in the web project.
5. **Using GitHub Actions**: We use the easingthemes/ssh-deploy@main action to deploy the project to the remote server.

The deployment steps include building the Docker image and running the Docker container with the necessary port
mappings:

```bash
docker build -t appflowy-web-app .
docker rm -f appflowy-web-app || true
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name appflowy-web-app appflowy-web-app
```

The Web server runs on Bun. For more details about Bun, please refer to the [Bun documentation](https://bun.sh/).
