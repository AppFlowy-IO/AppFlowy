## debuginfo — it makes ./target much bigger, which again harms caching. Depending on your preferred workflow,
## you might consider disabling debuginfo unconditionally, this brings some benefits for local builds as well.
#strip = "debuginfo"
## For from-scratch builds, incremental adds an extra dependency-tracking overhead. It also significantly increases
## the amount of IO and the size of ./target, which make caching less effective.
